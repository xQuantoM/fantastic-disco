# Project Roadmap: AI Workbench

This document outlines potential future features, improvements, and ideas for the AI Workbench application.

## Core Functionality Enhancements

*   **Advanced Error Handling:**
    *   Implement more user-friendly error messages across the application.
    *   Provide specific feedback for API errors (e.g., model not available, rate limits).
*   **Streaming for Image Generation:** If feasible via Puter.js, show image generation progress or a preview.
*   **Chat History:**
    *   Persist chat history locally (e.g., using LocalStorage).
    *   Allow users to export chat history.
*   **Context Management for Chat:**
    *   Implement a more sophisticated way to manage conversation context, especially for longer interactions.
    *   Allow users to clear or selectively manage context.

## UI/UX Improvements

*   **Theming:**
    *   Introduce light/dark mode toggle.
    *   Allow users to choose accent colors.
*   **Layout Options:** Explore options for resizable panels or different view configurations.
*   **Responsive Design:** Further improve responsiveness for various screen sizes, especially mobile.
*   **Loading Indicators:** More refined loading indicators for chat responses and image generation.
*   **Accessibility (a11y):** Conduct an accessibility review and implement improvements (e.g., ARIA attributes, keyboard navigation).

## Image Tool Enhancements

*   **Advanced Options:**
    *   Allow users to specify image dimensions.
    *   Add options for image style, quality, or other parameters supported by the backend.
*   **Image Gallery:**
    *   Display generated images in a more organized gallery view.
    *   Allow users to download or delete images from the gallery.
*   **Edit/Re-prompt Image:** Allow users to edit the prompt of a generated image or use an image as a base for a new prompt (if supported by Puter.js).

## AI Model Integration

*   **Model Capabilities Display:** Show information about the selected AI model (e.g., strengths, context window limits).
*   **Fine-grained Model Selection for Images:** If Puter.js supports different image models, allow selection.
*   **Support for other AI Modalities:** Explore adding voice input/output or other AI tools if Puter.js expands its offerings.

## Application Architecture & Technical Debt

*   **State Management:** Transition from direct DOM manipulation to a more robust client-side state management solution (e.g., a small state library or a structured vanilla JS approach) as the app grows.
*   **Code Modularization:** Break down the JavaScript code into smaller, more manageable modules.
*   **Build System:** If the project complexity increases significantly (e.g., with multiple JS/CSS files, TypeScript), introduce a simple build system (e.g., Parcel, esbuild).
*   **Automated Testing:**
    *   Add unit tests for critical JavaScript functions.
    *   Explore end-to-end testing for UI interactions.

## Settings & Personalization

*   **Client-Side Settings Persistence:**
    *   Remember the last selected AI model.
    *   Store user preferences (e.g., theme) in LocalStorage.
*   **API Key Management (if applicable):** If Puter.js usage evolves to require user-provided API keys for some services, provide a secure way to manage them.

This roadmap is a living document and will evolve as the project progresses and new ideas emerge.
